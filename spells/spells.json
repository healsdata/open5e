You cause the water level of all standing water\nin the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore,\nthe flooding water spills over onto dry land.\n\nIf you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a\n20 foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other\nand then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave’s path\nare carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles\nstruck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.\n\nThe water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a\ndifferent effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on\nthe start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.\n\nPart Water. You cause water in the area to move apart\nand create a trench. The trench extends across the spell’s area, and the\nseparated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until\nthe spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly\nfills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal\nwater level is restored.\n\nRedirect Flow. You cause flowing water in the area to\nmove in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over\nobstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the\narea moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell’s area,\nit resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues\nto move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a\ndifferent effect.\n\nWhirlpool. This effect requires a body of water at least\n50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the\ncenter of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at\nthe\n\nbase, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or\nobject in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet\ntoward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength\n(Athletics) check against your spell save DC.\n\nWhen a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts\nits turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save,\nthe creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex\nuntil the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half\ndamage, and isn’t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex\ncan use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described\nabove, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.\n\nThe first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object\ntakes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains\nin the vortex.",

If you choose an object, that object must remain in\nits place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast\nthis spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being\ntriggered.\n\nThe glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence\n(Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.\n\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs\ninscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or\nstanding on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph,\napproaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the\nobject on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an\nobject, the most common triggers include opening that object,\napproaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or\nreading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.\n\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under\ncertain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as\nheight or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to\naffect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions\nfor creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a\ncertain password.\n\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes\nor a spell glyph.\n\nExplosive Runes. When triggered, the glyph erupts with\nmagical energy in a 20 foot radius sphere centered on the glyph.\nThe sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a\nDexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire,\nlightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when\nyou create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful\none.\n\nSpell Glyph. You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level\nor lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The\nspell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored\nhas no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is\ntriggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it\ntargets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an\narea, the area is centered\n\non that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates\nharmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the\nintruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts\nuntil the end of its full duration.\n\n**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using\na spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an\nexplosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot\nlevel above 3rd.

The target shrinks to a height of 1\ninch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object.

The gemstone can’t be cut or\nbroken while the spell remains in effect.\n\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a large,\ntransparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.\n\nSlumber. The target falls asleep and can’t be awoken.\nThe special component for this version of the spell consists of rare\nsoporific herbs.\n\nEnding the Spell. During the casting of the spell, in\nany of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the\nspell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or\nas elaborate as you choose, but the GM must agree that the condition is\nreasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be\nbased on a creature’s name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be\nbased on\n\nobservable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as\nlevel, class, or hit points.\n\nA dispel magic spell can end the spell only if\nit is cast as a 9th level spell, targeting either the prison or the\nspecial component used to create it.\n\nYou can use a particular special component to create only one prison at\na time.

An\nunwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds,\nit is unaffected by this spell.\n\nThe spell disguises physical appearance as well as\n\nclothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem\n1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t\nchange a target’s body type, so you must choose a form that has the same\nbasic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up\nto you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to\ndismiss it sooner.\n\nThe changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical\ninspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a\ncreature’s outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches\nit would feel nothing or would feel the creature’s head and hair. If you\nuse this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who\nreaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly\nstill in midair.\n\nA creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an\nIntelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

For glyphs\ninscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or\nstepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching\nwithin a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds\nit. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are\nopening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or\nseeing or reading the glyph.\n\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under\ncertain circumstances or according to a creature’s physical\ncharacteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for\nexample, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can\nalso specify creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who\nsay a certain password.\n\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the\n\noptions below for its effect.

For instance, you could make yourself\nand all your companions immune to a lich’s life drain attack.\n\nYou undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made\nwithin the last round (including your last turn).
